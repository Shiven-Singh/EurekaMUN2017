				<h2>Model United Nations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic competition in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN teaches  researching and helps honing public speaking, debating and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. It is usually an extracurricular activity but some schools also offer MUN as a class.Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates are placed in committees and assigned countries or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body.</p>
				<p> They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics.Model UN participants include students at middle school, high school, and college/university levels with most conferences catering to just one of these three levels (high school and college conferences being the most common.) Delegates usually attend conferences together as delegations sent by their respective schools' or universities' Model UN clubs, though some delegates attend conferences independently.They conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations are  recognized with awards.</p>

							<h3> The United Nations Security Council  </h3>
							<br>
                            <p>Under the Charter, the Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members, and each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.

The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even authorize the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security.

For the sole purpose of having a brilliant debate, having a current topic is of importance and thus, we have decided to disclose it only 3 months prior to the conference.
</p>
		<h3>Agenda</h3>
        <p> The Situation in Somalia </p>
                            <p>
                            Civilians in Somalia, enduring abuses by all warring parties and dire humanitarian conditions, continue to bear the brunt of the country’s long-running conflict.
Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, particularly by the Islamist armed group Al-Shabab, with suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), have had a devastating impact: There are currently 1.1 million internally displaced people in Somalia, an estimated 400,000 living in Mogadishu alone, who remain very vulnerable and reliant on assistance.
Much of the focus of the Somali authorities and their international partners has been on the electoral process, which has largely detracted them from progress in justice and security sector reform. Targeted attacks on media, including harassment, and intimidation by federal and regional authorities and the Al-Shabab continue. Somaliland authorities continue with their negative trend of executions, with seven people executed in 2016.
The Security Council this year must aim to overcome the challenge of the difficulty of access to needy populations due to insecurity, restrictions imposed by parties to the conflict and targetted attacks.

                            
                            </p>

							<h3> The Historical Security Council   </h3>
							<br>
                            <p>The Historical Security Council (HSC) is exactly what you think it is; it is a reimagining of the Security Council (SC) at a certain point in history where delegates will discuss and hash out solutions to the most pressing issues of the time. The SC is tasked with “the maintenance of international peace and security” and as such the topics discussed can range anywhere from invasions to terrorism to establishing new governments. And although the actual SC of the time already issued resolutions of the topics that we will discuss this coming year, the delegates will not be bound to these past solutions. The goal of committee will be to learn about the politics and security concerns of a different time period and how they would have acted in comparison to their predecessors to ensure peace in the world.</p>

                            <p>Under the resolution 377A(V), "Uniting for peace", adopted by the General Assembly on 3 November 1950, an "emergency special session" can be convened within 24 hours:<br>

"Resolves that if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security. If not in session at the time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency special session shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the Members of the United Nations".</p>

							<h3>United Nations Children's Fund   </h3>
							<br>
                            <p>The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries that had been devastated by World War II. The Polish physician Ludwik Rajchman is widely regarded as the founder of UNICEF and served as its first chairman from 1946. On Rajchman's suggestion, the American Maurice Pate was appointed its first executive director, serving from 1947 until his death in 1965. In 1950, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women in developing countries everywhere. In 1953 it became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and the words "international" and "emergency" were dropped from the organization's name, making it simply the United Nations Children's Fund, retaining the original acronym, "UNICEF".</p>

							<h3>World Health Organization  </h3>
							<br>
                            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health. It was established on 7 April 1948, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the United Nations Development Group. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations.
The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the World Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the Office international d'hygiène publique and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its creation, it has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis; the mitigation of the effects of non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and ageing; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking.
The WHO is responsible for the World Health Report, a leading international publication on health, the worldwide World Health Survey, and World Health Day (7 April of every year). The Director-General of WHO is Margaret Chan. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected by the World Health Assembly on 23 May 2017 and will begin his five-year term on 1 July 2017.

							<h3>Commission on Narcotic Drugs   </h3>
							<br>
                            <p>The Commission on Narcotic Drugs is one of the functional commissions of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and is the central drug policy-making body within the United Nations system. The Commission has important functions under the drug control treaties in force today;[1] most notably, it can amend the Schedules of controlled substances under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
The Commission on Narcotic Drugs was established by the ECOSOC in 1946, with Canadian Charles Henry Ludovic Sharman as its first chair. Its predecessor, the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs, was established by the first Assembly of the League of Nations on December 15, 1920. The Advisory Committee held its first meeting from May 2 to May 5, 1921, and continued its activities until 1940.

                            <p>The International Press is a wing of an MUN which goes much beyond publicising conversations between delegates and clicking awkward brilliant photographs of you. Behind the newsletter and the photo gallery is a team of immensely talented, hard-working reporters and photographers who strive to bring you well-researched, authentic information in the form of concise, refined, and structured articles, as well as photographs which serve as evidence of your presence at the conference.</p>
